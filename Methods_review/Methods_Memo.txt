	 â€œWhat Do International Students Need?The Role of Family and Community Supports for Adjustment, Engagement, and Organizational Citizenship Behavior."
	 Journal of International Students 10(3):571-89

* Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations were used for this analysis. The authors employed confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling
to analyze the relationships between the factors and confirm the hypothesized model. Standardized path coefficients, decomposition of effects, and the bias
corrected bootstraps method were conducted to test the research hypotheses.

* Data was collected via an online survey distributed among all interantional students at a public university in Texas. However, to perform the data analysis,
it seems to me that the authors also adapted certain instruments and frameworks from previous scholars such as Herrero and Gracia (2007) and Black and Stephen
(1989). The survey and data are not open to public. I sent an email to the author to acquire the survey and the codes.

* The data is individual-based, and each data point represents an international graduate/undergrade student at a large public university in Texas.

* The study aims to investigate the relationships between:
- Perceived Family Support 
- Community Support
- Organizational Citizenship Behavior
Considering the following mediating effects on relationships:
- Cross-Cultural Adjustment
- Engagement

* Icomplete cases were removed from the data. Authors did not specify how exactly they dealth with missing data.

* There are two variables in this study that I'm interested in and might use later in my own work: perceived Community Support (PCS)
 and Cross-Cultural Adjustment (CCA)

* Latent profile analysis was used to identify latent subgroups of mental well-being and mental health. Latent profile analysis (LPA)
is a person-centered quantitative approach used to identify unmeasured subgroups of participant responses to continuous items. 
participants were then assigned to the items, allowing for interpreting results in terms of categorical grouping differences.
After identifying and describing the number of latent profiles, the authors assigned individuals to profiles and evaluated predictors
of the profiles using logistic regression analysis.

* The authors collected data via  questionnaires, annual surveys, in addition to writing samples and an account of scholarly productivity
 each year provided by PhD students. The data files are available to the public.

* The data studies individuals (graduate students), the underlying classification of individuals' mental well being and predictors of 
those classification. This study was a part of a larger longitudinal study on PhD students skill development in cellular and molecular
biological sciences in the United States.

* The following are the research measures: demographics, mental health and well-being, sense of belonging, certainty of choice,
academic development and satisfaction, mentoring relationships, research skills, publication output, and self efficacy.

* Missing data was handled using full information maximum likelihood with robust standard errors and Montecarlo integration in Mplus.

* I am interested in the following variables and models and might use them later in my research to apply them specifically to international
graduate students in the US, not just in STEM majors, but also humanities:
- Demographic variables since they include international students (Model 1)
- Certainty of Choice (Model 2)
- Academic Development (Model 3)
- Sense of belonging (Model 4)
- Satisfaction with advisor (Model 6)

	edited by M. Qian. _Cogent Psychology_ 7(1):1714101.

* Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted to develop the Multidimensional Acculturative Stress Scale. EFA has been extensively
used to determine construct validity. This technique is widely used to distribute the number of items among small meaningful factors,
and to identify the number of factors and to establish an association among observed variables.

* Data was collected through three sets of surveys: Acculturative Stress Scale, Depression Stress and Anxiety Scale, and Satisfaction 
With Life Scale. An additional demographic questionnaire was also provided to the participants. The data is not availiable to the public.
I sent an email to the authors to acquire information.

* The data is individual based and studies Muslim Pkaistani students during their stay abroad.

* Acculturative Stess Scale, the scale used in this study consisted of six domains of stressors: academic, general living and finance,
perceived discrimination, cultural and religious, local and environmental, and language barrier.

* The authors did not mention how they dealt with missing data.

* Some of the statemetns mentioned in the survey (Table 2) were interesting for  me. Also, I would like to incorporate the variable
'discrimiantion' regarding country, culture, ethnicity, and religion in my own research.
